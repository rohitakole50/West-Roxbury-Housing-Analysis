# West-Roxbury-Housing-Analysis

## Overview:

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the West Roxbury Housing dataset. The main objectives are to apply multiple linear regression techniques and understand the process of splitting data into training and validation sets. The analysis includes building regression models, validating these models, and interpreting the results. SAS JMP software is used for the statistical analysis.

## Objectives:

* To understand and apply the process of splitting data into training and validation sets.
* To build and interpret multiple linear regression models for the West Roxbury Housing dataset.
* To validate the regression models using the validation dataset.
* To identify the key predictors of property values in West Roxbury.

## Key Components:

### 1. Scatter Plots:

* Total Value vs. Tax: Positive collinearity between total value and tax.
* Total Value vs. Gross Area: Upward trend showing that as the gross area increases, the total value also increases.
* Total Value vs. Living Area: Similar trend to gross area, with more clustered data points.
* Total Value vs. Bedrooms: Positive correlation where the total value increases with the number of bedrooms.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression Models:

* Iterative process of building regression models to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
* Final model with stable variables, all p-values under 0.05, and acceptable VIF values.
* Created dummy variables/indicator columns for categorical variables like remodeling status.

### 3. Key Findings:

* Gross area is the best predictor of total value, followed by lot square footage.
* Recently remodeled houses have higher total values compared to houses with no remodeling.

## Tools and Technologies:

* SAS JMP software for data analysis and modeling.
* Microsoft Word for documenting the analysis and findings.

## Conclusion:

The West Roxbury Housing Data Analysis project demonstrates the application of multiple linear regression techniques and the process of data splitting for model validation. The project provides valuable insights into factors affecting housing values in West Roxbury. Through various analyses and iterations, the project highlights the importance of data integrity and model accuracy in predictive modeling.
